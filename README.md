## ABOUT THE APP
Friend Finder is a social match making app. This full-stack application takes in results from the users' response to a survey, then it compares their responses to those from other "users". The app will then display the best match in a modal showing the best match's name and photo.

The front end design was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and BootStrap. The backend is comprised of Javascript, Nodejs, 
and these 2 Node packages: [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) | [Path](https://www.npmjs.com/package/path).
